DEMO_Aralsea_Steps.r          Run both classic sparse Gaussian process regression and intrinsic sparse Gaussian process using heat kernel on Aral sea. The results are plotted as figures which are the same as in the paper.

Aralsea_Setup.r	            Load the Aral sea data and generate data points.

Aralsea_BM_sim.r      		Simulate BM paths on the Aral sea. This code was developed for parallel computation, if the user want to run on laptop or desktop, it may take longer. The function and results in this file are NOT required by DEMO_Aralsea_Steps.r

Aralsea_BM_TrDensity.r		Created lists of rows of covariance matrices from the BM paths given different choices of diffusion time. This file is NOT required by DEMO_Aralsea_Steps.r



The folder 'BM_Paths' stores the BM sample paths which are generated by Aralsea_BM_sim.r. It is empty because the sample path files are too big to upload to github. Users can download the code and generate paths by running Aralsea_BM_sim.r from their local machine.

The folder 'Cov_row_list' stores the estimated rows of covariance matrices for inducing points at different diffusion time. 

The folder 'Cov_row_list_uf' stores the estimated rows of covariance matrices between indcuing points and data points at different diffusion time. 

The folder 'Cov_row_list_fix' stores the estimated row of the cross covariance matrix of gird points and inducing points given the optimised diffusion time.

The folder 'inference' stores R6 class codes for computing Gaussian process regression prediction and intrinsic Gaussian process regression likelihoods and hyper parameters optimisatin.



For demonstration purpose, user can just run DEMO_Aralsea_Steps.r. If user want to reproduce the whole process as stated in the paper, user can following the steps below:
1) Generate BM sample paths by running Torus_BM_sim.r. parallel computing are recommended.

2) Generate estimated rows of Covariances matrices by running Torus_BM_TrDensity.r

3) run DEMO_Torus_Steps.r to produce GP and in-GP regression results.
